- [x] Remove deprecated matchTeam() and its 100-line abbrevMap from vsinScraper.ts (not called anywhere)
- [x] Fix stale comments in vsinAutoRefresh.ts (still references "03/04-03/10" in 3 places)

- [ ] Fix epochToEst() to return "TBD" instead of "00:00" when NCAA API returns no start time
- [ ] Clean up existing DB rows with bad 00:00 start times

## Midnight Game Header Display Fix (2026-03-06)
- [x] GameCard: when startTimeEst = "00:00", display header date as gameDate + 1 day (next ET calendar day), e.g. "Fri, Mar 6 · 12:00 AM ET"
- [x] EditableGameCard (PublishProjections): same fix — show next-day ET date in header for midnight games
- [x] Game remains grouped under gameDate (Thu, Mar 5) in the feed — only the header label changes

## Midnight Game Sort Order Fix (2026-03-06)

- [x] No white or black allowed on bars (isUnusableBarColor blocks both black <8% luminance and white >90% luminance)
- [x] Home team keeps primary unless it is white or black

## BettingSplitsPanel Color Assignment Audit (2026-03-07)
- [x] Verify each bar half uses only the hex color for the correct team (away left, home right) — no cross-contamination
- [x] Fix darkness threshold: lowered from 8% to 4% so deep purples (High Point) and dark maroons (Texas A&M) are allowed through

## Sprint Mar 15, 2026 — Part 3 (NHL Auto-Model + Goalie Fix)

- [ ] Fix nhlRotoWireScraper.ts: use .lineup__player-highlight selector, extract full goalie name from .lineup__player-highlight-name a, status from .is-confirmed/.is-expected class
- [ ] Fix RotoWire team abbrev extraction: use .lineup__abbr (is-visit = away, is-home = home) not the advanced-lineups approach
- [ ] Auto-trigger NHL model immediately when both goalies are populated for a game (in goalie watcher + on server startup)
- [ ] nhlModelSync.ts: on startup, run model for all today's NHL games that have both goalies but no modelRunAt
- [ ] Ensure every game card in Publish Projections shows goalie name + confirmed/expected status
- [ ] Fix goalie watcher to use correct HTML selectors matching pasted_content_21.txt structure

## NHL Model Improvements (2026-03-15 Session 2)
- [x] Display model puck line odds on public feed GameCard for NHL games (MODEL LINES column)
- [x] Display model total odds on public feed GameCard for NHL games (MODEL LINES column)
- [ ] Auto-trigger model run when both goalies are populated (GoalieWatcher + server startup)
- [ ] Add goalie confirmed/expected status badges to Publish Projections NHL game cards
- [ ] Rewrite NHL model engine: single Monte Carlo simulation core (N=50000 trials)
- [ ] All markets (ML, PL, O/U) derived from same simulation distribution
- [ ] Remove all separate calculation paths (no spread = expected_home - expected_away)
- [ ] Verify mathematically consistent outputs: ML/PL/total all from same sim
- [ ] Expand NST scraper to pull HDCF%, SCF%, HDCF/60, HDCA/60, Rush/60, RushA/60, Reb/60, Slot Shots for all teams
- [ ] Update NhlTeamStats type and DB schema with all new columns
- [ ] Remove fallback paths in compute_off_rating and compute_def_rating - require all fields
- [ ] Run DB migration and force model re-run with complete data
- [x] Fix goalie multiplier: Bayesian regression (K=500) prevents tiny-sample backups from dominating (Brossoit 1 GP: 1.106 → 1.004)
- [x] Add 6 new vitest tests for Bayesian goalie multiplier regression behavior (308 total passing)
- [x] Raise edge detection thresholds: ML=5pp, PL=6pp, Total=8pp to reduce noise
- [x] Re-run all 6 March 15 NHL games with corrected goalie model
- [ ] Fix total edge direction: book u6.5 +114 vs model u6.5 -118 should flag UNDER edge, not OVER
- [ ] Fix puck line model odds: +468/+155 are wildly wrong (should be realistic ±1.5 cover probabilities)
- [ ] Add nightly league-average recalibration cron job (scrape NST each morning, update engine constants)
- [ ] Add C3 violation alerts to Publish Projections admin panel (P(home-1.5) > P(home_win) flag)
- [ ] Full audit: NHL puck line odds calculation (Python engine) - mkt_pl_away_odds bug
- [ ] Full audit: NHL total odds calculation and edge direction (Python engine + GameCard)
- [ ] Full audit: NHL moneyline odds calculation (Python engine)
- [ ] Full audit: DB storage of model odds (nhlModelSync writes)
- [ ] Full audit: GameCard display of all NHL model values across all 3 panels
- [ ] Fix all identified bugs in puck line, total, ML calculations and display
- [x] Fix NHL puck line mkt_pl computation: favorite-aware logic (away-fav games were computing P(home wins by 2+) instead of P(away wins by 2+))
- [x] Fix NHL puck line edge detection: same favorite-aware fix applied to edge detection section
- [x] Fix NHL model spread display: modelAwayPuckLine/modelHomePuckLine now mirrors book spread (not model origination)
- [x] Fix NHL total edge direction: GameCard now uses model odds at book line to determine over/under edge direction
- [x] Fix ML vs puck line mathematical inconsistency: WPG ML=+106 (48.6% win) but WPG -1.5 puck line=-273 (73% cover) — impossible, team with 48.6% win rate cannot be 73% to win by 2+
- [x] Fix puck line favorite assignment: team with more negative ML should always be at -1.5; derive book spread from ML odds not spread field (STL -112 ML = STL is -1.5 favorite, not WPG)
- [x] NHL puck line fallback: when DK gives ML favorite a +1.5 spread, use FanDuel spread instead (if both DK and FD give +1.5 to ML fav, keep DK as-is)
- [ ] NHL puck line consensus: use DK + Open majority vote to determine -1.5 favorite (not ML-based); FD is outlier for STL@WPG
- [ ] NHL puck line best odds: display best available odds between DK NJ and FD NJ for each side of the puck line
- [ ] Revert NHL puck line to DK NJ only — remove FD fallback and ML-based override, use DK spread as-is
- [x] Fix STL@WPG spread: DK NJ has WPG Jets -1.5 (+235), STL Blues +1.5 (-290) — DB corrected + model re-run + edge label fix
- [x] Audit Python engine edge detection: verify model implied prob > book break-even prob for ML, PL, total
- [x] Fix any incorrect edge direction logic in Python engine
- [x] Add deep diagnostic logging for all edge calculations (break-even, implied prob, edge pp, verdict)
- [x] Fix mobile odds cell overlap: redesign OddsCell to two-line dark card style (line value top white, odds bottom neon green), fix grid spacing
- [x] Fix 1: One sticky global column header (SPREAD/TOTAL/ML + BOOK/MODEL sub-labels) — remove per-card headers
- [x] Fix 2: Collapse FINAL/LIVE status into card top-left — remove full-width status row
- [x] Fix 3: Remove green borders from MODEL cells — color-only distinction (bright green text, dark cell, no border)
- [x] Fix 4: Bind score tightly to team name — same row, adjacent, brand green when live
- [x] Fix 5: Add Edge Badge as rightmost column on each game card
- [x] Rename MDL → MODEL everywhere in UI
- [x] Implement calculateEdge/getVerdict/getEdgeColor helpers in GameCard.tsx (juice-only math, per-market independent)
- [x] Redesign EdgeBadge: 3 stacked rows (SPR/O/U/ML) with verdict label + pp value, dynamic bg/border from bestEdge
- [x] Apply BettingCell color grammar: line=white/75% 400 11px, juice=white/90% or neon green 700 18px
- [x] Wire all three market edges from juice numbers (not string parsing), recalculate on every render
- [x] Shrink left panel to 80px — keep logo (20px) and star button (compact 10px)
- [x] Show abbreviation-only team name (e.g. "STL") + score on same row in left panel
- [x] Replace circular sub-cells with flat 2-column BettingCell grid (BK/MDL headers, line, juice rows)
- [x] Equalize all 3 market columns to flex-1 (SPREAD/TOTAL/ML identical width)
- [x] EdgeBadge fixed at 60px (w-[60px] shrink-0)
- [x] Outer row: gap-[4px] to fit 375px screen budget
- [x] Make team logos bigger in left panel (from 20px to 28px)
- [x] Use city abbreviations instead of team abbreviations (NHL: official abbrev e.g. "NSH", "EDM")
- [x] Spell out BOOK and MODEL in BettingCell header (not BK/MDL)
- [x] Edge-conditional neon green: only MODEL juice is green when that side has an edge; both white if no edge
- [x] Add empty spacer row above ML odds to align with SPREAD/TOTAL line row height
- [x] Run NHL model for all 5 March 16 2026 games manually
- [x] Post all 5 NHL model projections to the main feed (publishedModel=1 for all 5 games)
- [x] Wire automatic daily NHL model execution (scheduler every 30min 9AM-9PM PST, auto-approve after each run)
