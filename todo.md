- [x] Remove deprecated matchTeam() and its 100-line abbrevMap from vsinScraper.ts (not called anywhere)
- [x] Fix stale comments in vsinAutoRefresh.ts (still references "03/04-03/10" in 3 places)

- [ ] Fix epochToEst() to return "TBD" instead of "00:00" when NCAA API returns no start time
- [ ] Clean up existing DB rows with bad 00:00 start times

## Midnight Game Header Display Fix (2026-03-06)
- [x] GameCard: when startTimeEst = "00:00", display header date as gameDate + 1 day (next ET calendar day), e.g. "Fri, Mar 6 · 12:00 AM ET"
- [x] EditableGameCard (PublishProjections): same fix — show next-day ET date in header for midnight games
- [x] Game remains grouped under gameDate (Thu, Mar 5) in the feed — only the header label changes

## Midnight Game Sort Order Fix (2026-03-06)

- [x] No white or black allowed on bars (isUnusableBarColor blocks both black <8% luminance and white >90% luminance)
- [x] Home team keeps primary unless it is white or black

## BettingSplitsPanel Color Assignment Audit (2026-03-07)
- [x] Verify each bar half uses only the hex color for the correct team (away left, home right) — no cross-contamination
- [x] Fix darkness threshold: lowered from 8% to 4% so deep purples (High Point) and dark maroons (Texas A&M) are allowed through

## NHL Model Improvements (2026-03-15 Session 2)
- [x] Display model puck line odds on public feed GameCard for NHL games (MODEL LINES column)
- [x] Display model total odds on public feed GameCard for NHL games (MODEL LINES column)
- [ ] Auto-trigger model run when both goalies are populated (GoalieWatcher + server startup)
- [ ] Add goalie confirmed/expected status badges to Publish Projections NHL game cards
- [ ] Rewrite NHL model engine: single Monte Carlo simulation core (N=50000 trials)
- [ ] All markets (ML, PL, O/U) derived from same simulation distribution
- [ ] Remove all separate calculation paths (no spread = expected_home - expected_away)
- [ ] Verify mathematically consistent outputs: ML/PL/total all from same sim
- [ ] Expand NST scraper to pull HDCF%, SCF%, HDCF/60, HDCA/60, Rush/60, RushA/60, Reb/60, Slot Shots for all teams
- [ ] Update NhlTeamStats type and DB schema with all new columns
- [ ] Remove fallback paths in compute_off_rating and compute_def_rating - require all fields
- [ ] Run DB migration and force model re-run with complete data

- [ ] Add nightly league-average recalibration cron job (scrape NST each morning, update engine constants)
- [ ] Add C3 violation alerts to Publish Projections admin panel (P(home-1.5) > P(home_win) flag)
- [ ] Full audit: NHL puck line odds calculation (Python engine) - mkt_pl_away_odds bug
- [ ] Full audit: NHL total odds calculation and edge direction (Python engine + GameCard)

- [ ] Full audit: DB storage of model odds (nhlModelSync writes)
- [ ] Full audit: GameCard display of all NHL model values across all 3 panels
- [ ] Fix all identified bugs in puck line, total, ML calculations and display
- [x] Fix NHL puck line mkt_pl computation: favorite-aware logic (away-fav games were computing P(home wins by 2+) instead of P(away wins by 2+))
- [x] Fix NHL puck line edge detection: same favorite-aware fix applied to edge detection section
- [x] Fix NHL model spread display: modelAwayPuckLine/modelHomePuckLine now mirrors book spread (not model origination)
- [x] Fix NHL total edge direction: GameCard now uses model odds at book line to determine over/under edge direction
- [x] Fix ML vs puck line mathematical inconsistency: WPG ML=+106 (48.6% win) but WPG -1.5 puck line=-273 (73% cover) — impossible, team with 48.6% win rate cannot be 73% to win by 2+
- [x] Fix puck line favorite assignment: team with more negative ML should always be at -1.5; derive book spread from ML odds not spread field (STL -112 ML = STL is -1.5 favorite, not WPG)
- [x] NHL puck line fallback: when DK gives ML favorite a +1.5 spread, use FanDuel spread instead (if both DK and FD give +1.5 to ML fav, keep DK as-is)
- [ ] NHL puck line consensus: use DK + Open majority vote to determine -1.5 favorite (not ML-based); FD is outlier for STL@WPG
- [ ] NHL puck line best odds: display best available odds between DK NJ and FD NJ for each side of the puck line
- [ ] Revert NHL puck line to DK NJ only — remove FD fallback and ML-based override, use DK spread as-is
- [x] Fix STL@WPG spread: DK NJ has WPG Jets -1.5 (+235), STL Blues +1.5 (-290) — DB corrected + model re-run + edge label fix
- [x] Audit Python engine edge detection: verify model implied prob > book break-even prob for ML, PL, total
- [x] Fix any incorrect edge direction logic in Python engine
- [x] Add deep diagnostic logging for all edge calculations (break-even, implied prob, edge pp, verdict)
- [x] Fix mobile odds cell overlap: redesign OddsCell to two-line dark card style (line value top white, odds bottom neon green), fix grid spacing
- [x] Fix 1: One sticky global column header (SPREAD/TOTAL/ML + BOOK/MODEL sub-labels) — remove per-card headers
- [x] Fix 2: Collapse FINAL/LIVE status into card top-left — remove full-width status row
- [x] Fix 3: Remove green borders from MODEL cells — color-only distinction (bright green text, dark cell, no border)
- [x] Fix 4: Bind score tightly to team name — same row, adjacent, brand green when live
- [x] Fix 5: Add Edge Badge as rightmost column on each game card
- [x] Rename MDL → MODEL everywhere in UI
- [x] Implement calculateEdge/getVerdict/getEdgeColor helpers in GameCard.tsx (juice-only math, per-market independent)
- [x] Redesign EdgeBadge: 3 stacked rows (SPR/O/U/ML) with verdict label + pp value, dynamic bg/border from bestEdge
- [x] Apply BettingCell color grammar: line=white/75% 400 11px, juice=white/90% or neon green 700 18px
- [x] Wire all three market edges from juice numbers (not string parsing), recalculate on every render
- [x] Shrink left panel to 80px — keep logo (20px) and star button (compact 10px)
- [x] Show abbreviation-only team name (e.g. "STL") + score on same row in left panel
- [x] Replace circular sub-cells with flat 2-column BettingCell grid (BK/MDL headers, line, juice rows)
- [x] Equalize all 3 market columns to flex-1 (SPREAD/TOTAL/ML identical width)
- [x] EdgeBadge fixed at 60px (w-[60px] shrink-0)
- [x] Outer row: gap-[4px] to fit 375px screen budget
- [x] Make team logos bigger in left panel (from 20px to 28px)
- [x] Use city abbreviations instead of team abbreviations (NHL: official abbrev e.g. "NSH", "EDM")
- [x] Spell out BOOK and MODEL in BettingCell header (not BK/MDL)
- [x] Edge-conditional neon green: only MODEL juice is green when that side has an edge; both white if no edge
- [x] Add empty spacer row above ML odds to align with SPREAD/TOTAL line row height
- [x] Run NHL model for all 5 March 16 2026 games manually
- [x] Post all 5 NHL model projections to the main feed (publishedModel=1 for all 5 games)
- [x] Wire automatic daily NHL model execution (scheduler every 30min 9AM-9PM PST, auto-approve after each run)

## UI/Discord Fixes (March 18, 2026)

- [x] Write test-discord-connect.ts: verifies JWT → /connect → DB state row inserted → correct redirect_uri
- [x] Write test-discord-callback.ts: verifies DB state lookup → token exchange → state consumed
- [x] Both test scripts PASS: state_mismatch eliminated, token_exchange_failed on fake code (expected)
- [x] TypeScript: 0 errors. 23/23 Discord tests passing.
- [ ] Test Discord OAuth end-to-end on published site after publishing

## Discord Button Branding & One-Time Lock (March 18, 2026)
- [x] Restyle Discord button: solid #738ADB bg, white text, GG Sans font, Discord SVG logo — no opacity/transparency
- [x] Not connected state: Discord logo + "CONNECT DISCORD" (white, GG Sans, read-only link to /api/auth/discord/connect)

## Mobile Header Layout Fix (March 18, 2026)
- [x] Fix PREZ BETS title overlapping CONNECT DISCORD button on mobile
- [x] Removed absolute centering (absolute left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2) — replaced with left-aligned flex item
- [x] PREZ BETS left-aligned, Discord button + user icon right-aligned via flex-1 spacer

- [x] March 17 First Four games (UMBC vs Howard, Texas vs NC State) — already played, not added (daily purge would delete them; historical only)
- [x] VSiN has not yet posted R64 odds (March 19-20 games) — auto-refresh will pick them up as they go live
- [x] Publish BYU vs Texas and Howard vs Michigan (R64 games with complete odds+splits) — published ✅
- [x] Unpublish 4 non-bracket contaminating games (navy/wake_forest, dayton/bradley, george_washington/utah_valley, sam_houston_st/new_mexico)
- [x] isValidGame filter in routers.ts confirmed working — blocks all non-bracket NCAAM teams at API layer

- [x] Trigger model watcher for 2026-03-21 — modeled 7 games (Michigan St, TCU, Nebraska, Arkansas, Saint Louis, VCU, Liberty)
- [x] All 16 March 20 NCAAM games: published=16/16, modeled=16/16

## Bracket Tab Full Overhaul (2026-03-20)
- [x] Teams must STAY in R64 slot with final scores; loser dimmed, winner highlighted — do NOT remove teams from R64
- [x] Winners correctly populate R32/R16/E8/F4/Championship slots
- [x] Connector SVG lines: gapless, no disconnected matchups in any region
- [x] Zoom/scroll/pan: fully functional on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [x] Responsive scaling: correct bracket sizing across all screen sizes
- [x] Full audit: all regions (SOUTH, EAST, MIDWEST, WEST), all rounds, all scores accurate
- [x] Debug logging: bracket data flow from DB → component → render
- [x] Re-insert 16 missing R64 games + 4 First Four games deleted by daily purge
- [x] Protect bracket games from daily purge (bracketGameId IS NOT NULL exclusion in deleteOldGames)
- [x] Auto-scale on load: bracket fits viewport width after data loads (useLayoutEffect + setTimeout 300ms)
- [x] Auto-scale re-runs on window resize

## Bracket Mobile Fix (2026-03-20)
- [ ] Fix auto-scale not firing on mobile (375px viewport) — bracket renders at full 2012px width- [x] Fix auto-scale on mobile — ResizeObserver on bk-layout to read offsetWidth (not scrollWidth inside overflow:hidden)
- [x] Fix touch zoom/pan — pinch-to-zoom and drag-to-pan on iOS Safari
- [x] Fix page scroll conflict — bracket container must capture touch events without blocking page scroll
- [x] Fix bracket container height on mobile — must fill viewport without overflow
- [x] Ensure transform-origin is top-left so scaled bracket starts at top-left corner of bracket canvas on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## Bracket Connector Audit (2026-03-20)
- [ ] Deep debug connector logic: inject articulate logging for all card positions, midpoints, path coordinates
- [ ] Fix connector gaps: every R64→R32→S16→E8 transition must be gapless in all 4 regions
- [ ] Fix RTL connector direction: WEST and MIDWEST regions connect right-to-left correctly
- [ ] Verify connector scaling: paths are drawn in the wrap coordinate space (unaffected by canvas scale transform)
- [ ] Verify connector redraw fires after auto-scale changes the canvas transform

## Bracket Connector Full Fix (2026-03-20)
- [ ] Fix drawConnectors: use cy(tgt) as yMid convergence point (not midpoint of source cards)
- [ ] Fix R64→R32→S16→E8 connectors in all 4 regions (28 transitions, max 40.1px offset)
- [ ] Fix E8→Final Four connectors (LTR E8 right edge → FF left; RTL E8 left edge → FF right)
- [ ] Fix Final Four→Championship connectors (FF top/bottom cards → Champ center)
- [ ] Verify all transitions ≤1px offset after fix

## Bracket Layout Redesign — Championship Dead Center (2026-03-20)
- [ ] Championship card must be in the absolute dead center of the bracket canvas
- [ ] Work backwards: FF cards flank Championship left/right, E8 cards flank FF, S16 flank E8, R32 flank S16, R64 outermost
- [ ] All connectors radiate inward from R64 → R32 → S16 → E8 → FF → Championship
- [ ] EAST and SOUTH regions on the LEFT half (LTR), WEST and MIDWEST on the RIGHT half (RTL)
- [ ] Vertical centering: Championship at vertical midpoint, regions stacked above/below

## Bracket Spacing / Overlap Fix (2026-03-20)
- [ ] Compute mathematically exact layout: no overlap, no clamping, consistent gaps across all rounds
- [ ] Championship at exact dead center (y = layoutHeight / 2)
- [ ] FF cards equidistant above/below Championship, not overlapping E8 cards
- [ ] R64 gaps computed from card height so no cards overlap within a column
- [ ] R32/S16/E8 gaps computed as 2x/4x/8x the R64 gap (standard bracket doubling)
- [ ] ROUND_PAD values computed so card[0] center aligns with its feeder midpoint
- [ ] All connector paths arrive at exact card center-Y (no offset)

## Discord Splits Card Quality Improvements (2026-03-24)
- [x] Embed Barlow Condensed fonts as base64 data URIs in splits_card.html (no CDN dependency)

- [x] Increase market section fonts: labels 12px → 16px, line values 26px → 36px, bars 26px → 34px

## Discord Splits Card Logo Fix (2026-03-24)
- [x] Debug onerror handler: ROOT CAUSE = inline onerror with double-quoted style string broke HTML attribute parsing, leaking fallback text as DOM content
- [x] Fix logoHTML function: removed inline onerror entirely, use hidden .abbr-fallback span + JS addEventListener after DOM build
- [x] Verified fix with GSW/DAL logos: images load cleanly (naturalWidth=500), fallback span stays display:none
- [x] Rebuilt splits_card.html v4 with corrected logo rendering

## Remove March Madness Bracket (2026-03-24)
- [x] Remove Bracket tab from navigation/sidebar (FEED_TABS, bracket pill button)
- [x] Delete MarchMadnessBracket.tsx page component permanently
- [x] Remove /bracket route and MarchMadnessBracket import from App.tsx
- [x] Remove bracket type from FeedMobileTab, GameCard props, VirtualizedGameList
- [x] Remove CDN_MARCH_MADNESS constant and March Madness icon from nav pill
- [x] NCAAM pill now shows plain text label with no icon

## Sport Tab Auto-Hide (2026-03-24)
- [x] Add tRPC procedure games.activeSports returning which sports have games today or tomorrow (UTC)
- [x] Add getActiveSports() helper to db.ts using groupBy query on gameDate + sport
- [x] Update ModelProjections.tsx to query activeSports and hide pills with no upcoming games
- [x] Auto-switch selected sport if current sport becomes hidden (fallback: NHL → NBA → NCAAM)
- [x] Pills show during loading (activeSports undefined) to avoid flash of empty nav

## NCAAM Tab Visibility Bug (2026-03-24)
- [x] Debug: ROOT CAUSE = getActiveSports counted unpublished regular season NCAAM games (wichita_st@tulsa, st_josephs@new_mexico) that have odds but publishedToFeed=0 and no bracketGameId
- [x] Fix: NCAAM now requires bracketGameId IS NOT NULL — only March Madness bracket games trigger the tab
- [x] Verified: [activeSports] log confirms NCAAM=false when no bracket games exist today/tomorrow

## Discord Splits Card Total Bar Colors (2026-03-24)
- [x] Over bar: now uses CSS var(--away-primary) — matches away team color
- [x] Under bar: now uses CSS var(--home-primary) — matches home team color
- [x] Verified via test render: MIL(green) Over / LAC(blue) Under display correctly

## /splits Command Channel Targeting (2026-03-24)
- [ ] Audit splitsCommand.ts: find where target channel is set (hardcoded vs interaction.channelId)
- [ ] Update execute() to post cards to interaction.channelId (the channel where /splits was run)
- [ ] Add detailed logging: log channelId, gameCount, and per-card success/failure
- [ ] Verify TypeScript compiles cleanly

## /splits Channel Targeting + NYI/NYR Fix (2026-03-24)
- [x] Fix stray backtick syntax error on summary line in splitsCommand.ts (auto-fixed by file tool)
- [x] /splits posts to interaction.channelId (channel where command was run) — removed hardcoded SPLITS_CHANNEL_ID
- [x] Deep debug NYI/NYR splits loading failure:
      ROOT CAUSE: vsinAutoRefresh.ts used raw NHL_BY_VSIN_SLUG.get(g.awayVsinSlug) without applying
      VSIN_NHL_HREF_ALIASES first. VSiN page sends "ny-islanders" and "ny-rangers" but the map
      is keyed on "new-york-islanders" and "new-york-rangers". Silent miss = NULL splits every time.
- [x] Fix: added resolveNhlVsinSlug() helper that applies VSIN_NHL_HREF_ALIASES before map lookup
- [x] Replaced both raw NHL_BY_VSIN_SLUG.get() call sites (today + tomorrow blocks) with resolveNhlVsinSlug()
- [x] Added detailed alias-resolution logging to confirm matches in server logs
- [x] Zero raw NHL_BY_VSIN_SLUG.get() calls remain in the codebase
- [x] Future aliases: add to VSIN_NHL_HREF_ALIASES in shared/nhlTeams.ts only — no code changes needed elsewhere

## Discord Splits Card Team Name Fix (2026-03-24)
- [x] Audit how city/nickname are passed to splits card template (buildCardData in splitsCommand.ts)
- [x] Fixed city/nickname for all NHL/NBA multi-word teams: added city+nickname fields to TeamEntry interface,
      populated from NHL_TEAMS/NBA_TEAMS shared registries (which already have city/nickname),
      fetchSplits.ts now passes away_city/away_nickname/home_city/home_nickname,
      splitsCommand.ts uses these directly instead of splitTeamName() — no more wrapping bugs
- [x] Ensure city line never wraps (single line always) — verified in test renders
- [x] Ensure nickname line never wraps (single line always) — verified in test renders
- [x] Test render VGK, CBJ, TOR, GSW, OKC cards to verify correct display — all confirmed working

## Production ENOENT Fix (2026-03-24)
- [x] Fixed ENOENT: splits_card.html not found in production (/usr/src/app/dist/splits_card.html)
      Root cause: esbuild bundles TS into dist/index.js but never copies static assets.
      In prod, import.meta.url = dist/index.js so __dirname = dist/, but splits_card.html was only in server/discord/.
      Fix: updated build script in package.json to cp splits_card.html, model_v10_engine.py, nhl_model_engine.py to dist/ after esbuild.
      All three files now present in dist/ after build. Verified build output.

## Discord Bot "Application Did Not Respond" Fix (2026-03-24)
- [x] Audit full interaction handling chain: bot.ts, splitsCommand.ts, defer/timeout logic
- [x] Identified root cause: Discord gateway duplicate delivery — same interaction ID delivered twice;
      second delivery hits deferReply on already-acknowledged interaction → throws → outer catch
      tries interaction.reply() but interaction is in broken state → Discord sees no valid response
- [x] Implemented guaranteed immediate deferReply at very top of handleSplitsCommand (before auth check)
      wrapped in try/catch: if deferReply fails (duplicate), bail out immediately with no further action
- [x] Moved access control AFTER deferReply so unauthorized users get editReply (not reply)
- [x] Added interaction deduplication guard in bot.ts: tracks seen interaction IDs for 10s,
      drops duplicates before they reach the command handler
- [x] Added interaction ID to all log lines for full traceability
- [x] Improved outer catch in bot.ts: checks deferred/replied state before choosing editReply vs reply
      logs reply failures separately instead of swallowing them

## /splits Command Performance Optimization (2026-03-24)
- [x] Profiled: 11.6s breakdown = 8.8s Playwright cold-start (76%) + 1.1s render + 0.45s upload + 0.16s deferReply
- [x] Identified root bottleneck: Chromium launched fresh on every command (no warm browser)
- [x] Implemented warmUpRenderer() called on bot login: Chromium + template + 2 pooled pages ready in ~2.6s
      First /splits after restart now finds warm browser — cold-start eliminated
- [x] Parallel rendering: all cards rendered concurrently with Promise.all() — N games = ~1x render time
- [x] Template HTML cached in memory at module load (1.1 MB read once, not on every render)
- [x] Parallel logo fetch: away+home logos fetched with Promise.all() instead of sequentially
- [x] Warm page pool: 2 pre-opened pages maintained; refilled async after each render
- [x] IMAGE_DELAY_MS reduced from 1500ms to 800ms (safe: 1.25 msg/s vs Discord limit of 1 msg/s)
- [x] Granular timing logs: each phase (logo fetch, page claim, setContent, screenshot) logged with ms
- [x] Expected result: 1-card warm = ~1.5s, 4-card warm = ~2.5s (parallel render) + 3x800ms gaps = ~5s total

- [x] Add MLB to triggerRefresh procedure in routers.ts
- [x] Verify all three pipelines fire correctly and update DB on schedule

## MLB Splits Fix (2026-03-24)
- [x] Diagnosed: VSiN MLB uses dedicated URL (data.vsin.com/mlb/betting-splits/) not combined page
- [x] Fixed: MLB column order is ML(1-3) → Total(4-6) → RL(7-9), opposite of NBA/NHL order

- [x] EdgeVerdict clamp floor reduced: 150px → 120px (clamp(120px,11.5vw,190px)) — +10px per SectionCol at 768px
- [x] Sport pills md: breakpoint: px-3, py-2, gap-1.5, logo 14px, font 13px at 768px+
- [x] Favorites button md: breakpoint: px-3, py-2, gap-2, text-[13px] at 768px+
- [x] Sport pills container: md:px-4 md:gap-3 for better tablet spacing
- [x] Pixel-perfect width audit: 768px SectionCol=158px, 820px SectionCol=172px (both above 104px min)

## Tablet Scaling Session (Apr 13, 2026)
- [x] md: tab bar scaling — CSS @media (min-width: 768px) override for .feed-tab: padding 10px 18px, font-size 12px, letter-spacing 0.07em
- [x] md: CalendarPicker scaling — md:gap-2 md:px-3 md:py-2 md:text-[13px] md:w-4 md:h-4 on trigger button
- [x] ScorePanel team name audit — verified all 80+ MLB/NHL/NBA names fit at 13px within 110px available width at 768px (max "San Francisco" = 79.3px). No overflow. No font size change needed.
- [x] Dead code removal — removed 102 lines of dead useAutoFontSize/computeAutoFontSize/measureTextWidth/_autoFontCanvas code from GameCard.tsx (was defined but never called)
- [x] GameCard.tsx reduced from 3,802 → 3,712 lines (-90 lines net after all changes)

## Tablet Header/Tab Scaling (Apr 13, 2026 — Session 2)
- [x] Search bar md: scaling — md:text-[13px] on input, md:py-2 md:px-3 on container, md:w-4 md:h-4 on Search/X icons
- [x] Sticky header height md: scaling — Row 1 md:pt-3 md:pb-2, Row 3 md:pt-2 md:pb-1 (auto-height header expands naturally)
- [x] Tab bar fade-right gradient scroll indicator — tabsScrollRef + tabsShowFade state + ResizeObserver; fade auto-hides when content fits or user scrolls to end

## Tablet Header + Tab UX + Apr 12 Seeding (Apr 13, 2026 — Session 3)
- [x] Date header Row 4 md: scaling — md:py-2 on container + clamp(8px,2.1vw,14px) league label + favorites header md:py-2 + clamp(11px,2vw,15px)
- [x] Active tab scroll-into-view on sport switch — useEffect on selectedSport + rAF + data-active attr + querySelector + scrollIntoView inline:nearest
- [x] Seed Apr 12 MLB games: CWS@KC, PIT@CHC, HOU@SEA — AN API book_id=30 opening lines, patch_apr12_missing.ts, 3/3 patched+verified

## Tab Font Scaling + Smooth Scroll + Apr 12 Model Cycle (Apr 14, 2026 — Session 4)
- [x] Feed tab bar label md: font scaling — index.css @media 768px font-size: 15px + padding: 10px 20px (math: 6 tabs=640px ≤ 768px)
- [x] Active tab scroll-into-view smooth behavior — behavior: 'smooth' added to scrollIntoView call
- [x] Apr 12 MLB model cycle — CORRECTED: games were NOT purged (false alarm from Drizzle ORM bug); model ran successfully, 15/15 MODEL_OK

## MLB Purge Bug — Full Audit + Fix (Apr 14, 2026 — Session 5)
- [x] Audit all game delete/purge code paths — cron jobs, tRPC, direct DB calls (RESULT: no purge occurred; dailyPurge.ts is a no-op since 2026-03-25; only 3 delete paths exist: deleteModelFile, deleteGamesByFileId, deleteGameById — all owner-triggered, none automatic)
- [x] Trace exact purge execution — ROOT CAUSE: check_apr12_model.ts had 2 bugs: (1) gte/lte on string gameDate column returns 0 rows due to Drizzle ORM type coercion; (2) sport='mlb' (lowercase) doesn’t match DB value 'MLB' (uppercase). All 15 Apr 12 games are intact in DB (2,430 total MLB rows: 2026-03-25 → 2026-09-27)
- [x] Fix: corrected check_apr12_model.ts to use eq() + uppercase 'MLB'; ran MLB model for Apr 12 → 15/15 MODEL_OK (PIT@CHC + HOU@SEA now have full projections); 0 TypeScript errors; 458/458 tests pass

## lg: Tab Bar + Script Guards + Apr 13 Audit + Logos/Abbrevs (Apr 14, 2026 — Session 6)
- [x] Add lg: breakpoint to .feed-tab CSS — index.css @media 1024px: font-size: 17px + padding: 11px 22px (math: 6 MLB tabs=712px ≤ 1024px with 312px spare)
- [x] DB query guard for all diagnostic scripts — fixed 4 lowercase 'mlb' occurrences in 3 scripts; added check_team_keys.ts audit script (MLB_BY_ABBREV/NHL_BY_DB_SLUG/getNbaTeamByDbSlug all 30/30 hits)
- [x] Verify Apr 13 MLB model cycle — 10/10 MODEL_OK; MLBCycle FAILED(6) is for Apr 14 future games without pitchers (normal, not a bug)
- [x] Audit team logo visibility/readability — all 3 sports 100% hit rate: MLB_BY_ABBREV(30/30), NHL_BY_DB_SLUG(30/30), getNbaTeamByDbSlug(30/30); logos render via official CDN URLs
- [x] Audit and fix team abbreviations — nbaTeams.ts: added abbrev field to NbaTeam interface + all 30 official NBA abbreviations (BOS/BKN/NYK/PHI/TOR/CHI/CLE/DET/IND/MIL/ATL/CHA/MIA/ORL/WAS/DEN/MIN/OKC/POR/UTA/GSW/LAC/LAL/PHX/SAC/DAL/HOU/MEM/NOP/SAS); GameCard.tsx: makeCityAbbr now uses NHL→NBA→MLB official abbrev (30/30 MLB fixed: NYY/NYM/LAA/LAD/CWS/CHC/STL/KC/TB/SF/SD etc.)
