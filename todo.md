- [x] Remove deprecated matchTeam() and its 100-line abbrevMap from vsinScraper.ts (not called anywhere)
- [x] Fix stale comments in vsinAutoRefresh.ts (still references "03/04-03/10" in 3 places)

- [ ] Consolidate ESPN logo source: teams.list DB query is redundant since registry has NCAA logos for all 365 teams (deferred — ESPN sync still used as fallback)

## Midnight Game Date + Start Time Fixes (2026-03-06)

- [ ] Fix epochToEst() to return "TBD" instead of "00:00" when NCAA API returns no start time
- [ ] Clean up existing DB rows with bad 00:00 start times

## Midnight Game Header Display Fix (2026-03-06)
- [x] GameCard: when startTimeEst = "00:00", display header date as gameDate + 1 day (next ET calendar day), e.g. "Fri, Mar 6 · 12:00 AM ET"
- [x] EditableGameCard (PublishProjections): same fix — show next-day ET date in header for midnight games
- [x] Game remains grouped under gameDate (Thu, Mar 5) in the feed — only the header label changes

## Midnight Game Sort Order Fix (2026-03-06)

## BettingSplitsPanel WCAG Bar Text Contrast (2026-03-07)

- [x] No white or black allowed on bars (isUnusableBarColor blocks both black <8% luminance and white >90% luminance)
- [x] Home team keeps primary unless it is white or black

## BettingSplitsPanel Color Assignment Audit (2026-03-07)
- [x] Verify each bar half uses only the hex color for the correct team (away left, home right) — no cross-contamination
- [x] Fix darkness threshold: lowered from 8% to 4% so deep purples (High Point) and dark maroons (Texas A&M) are allowed through
